# TripAdvisor-WebScraping
I collaborated with the "Analisti Anonimi" team on a project focused on Web Scraping TripAdvisor for the top 5 restaurants in Naples. We conducted Sentiment Analisys on positive and negative reviews, along with generating Word Clouds to analyze key trends. Finally, everything was then entered into a Database using SQL.
